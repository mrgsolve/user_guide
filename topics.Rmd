# Topics {#topics}

## Annotated model specification {#topic-annotated}
Here is a complete annotated `mrgsolve` model.  The goal was to get in several
of the most common blocks that you might want to annotate.  The different code
blocks are rendered here separately for clarity in presentation; but users
should include all relevant blocks in a single file (or R string).

### Summary

- `mrgsolve` keeps a base list of compartments and initial conditions that 
  you can update **either** from `R` or from inside the model specification
- When you use `$CMT`, the value in that base list is assumed to be 0 for 
  every compartment
- `mrgsolve` will by default use the values in that base list when starting 
  the problem
- When only the base list is available, every individual will get the same 
  initial condition
- You can **override** this base list by including code in `$MAIN` to set 
  the initial condition
- Most often, you do this so that the initial is calculated as a function 
  of a parameter
- For example, `$MAIN RESP_0 = KIN/KOUT;` when `KIN` and `KOUT` have some value in `$PARAM`
- This code in `$MAIN` overwrites the value in the base list for the current `ID`
- For typical PK/PD type models, we most frequently initialize in `$MAIN`
- This is equivalent to what you might do in your NONMEM model
- For larger systems models, we often just set the initial value via the base list

### Make a model only to examine `init` behavior

Note: `IFLAG` is my invention only for this demo. The demo is always responsible
for setting and interpreting the value (it is not reserved in any way and
`mrgsolve` does not control the value).

For this demo

-   Compartment `A` initial condition defaults to 0
-   Compartment `A` initial condition will get set to `BASE` **only** if `IFLAG  > 0`
-   Compartment `A` always stays at the initial condition

``` {r}
code <- '
$PARAM BASE=100, IFLAG = 0

$CMT A

$MAIN

if(IFLAG > 0) A_0 = BASE;

$ODE dxdt_A = 0;
'
```

``` {r inits-mread,cache=TRUE}
mod <- mcode("init",code)
```

**Check the initial condition**

``` {r}
init(mod)
```

Note:

-   We used `$CMT` in the model spec; that implies that the base initial 
condition for `A` is set to 0
-   In this chunk, the code in `$MAIN` doesn't get run because `IFLAG` is 0
-   So, if we don't update something in `$MAIN` the initial condition is as we 
set it in the base list

``` {r topic-init-2, cache=TRUE}
mod %>% mrgsim %>% plot
```


**Next, we update the base initial condition for `A` to 50**

Note:

-   The code in `$MAIN` still doesn't get run because `IFLAG` is 0

``` {r topic-init-3,cache=TRUE}
mod %>% init(A = 50) %>% mrgsim %>% plot
```

**Now, turn on `IFLAG`**

Note:

-   Now, that code in `$MAIN` gets run
-   `A_0` is set to the value of `BASE`

``` {r topic-init-4,cache=TRUE}
mod %>% param(IFLAG=1) %>% mrgsim %>% plot
```


``` {r topic-init-5,cache=TRUE}
mod %>% param(IFLAG=1, BASE=300) %>% mrgsim %>% plot
```


### Example PK/PD model with initial condition


Just to be clear, there is no need to set any sort of flag to set the initial 
condition as seen here:  

``` {r}
code <- '
$PARAM AUC=0, AUC50 = 75, KIN=200, KOUT=5

$CMT RESP

$MAIN 
RESP_0 = KIN/KOUT;

$ODE

dxdt_RESP = KIN*(1-AUC/(AUC50+AUC)) - KOUT*RESP;

'
```

``` {r topic-init-6,cache=TRUE}
mod <- mcode("init2", code)
```

The initial condition is set to 40 per the values of `KIN` and `KOUT`

``` {r topic-init-7, cache=TRUE}
mod %>% mrgsim %>% plot
```

Even when we change `RESP_0` in `R`, the calculation in `$MAIN` gets the final say

``` {r topic-init-8, cache=TRUE}
mod %>% init(RESP=1E9) %>% mrgsim
```


### Remember: calling `init` will let you check to see what is going on

-  It's a good idea to get in the habit of doing this when things aren't clear
-  `init` first takes the base initial condition list, then calls `$MAIN` and 
does any calculation you have in there; so the result is the calculated initials

``` {r, topic-init-9}
init(mod)
```

``` {r, topic init 10}
mod %>% param(KIN=100) %>% init
```



### Set initial conditions via `idata`

Go back to house model

``` {r, init-by-idata-house}
mod <- mrgsolve:::house()
```

``` {r,init-by-idata-init}
init(mod)
```

Notes

-  In `idata` (only), include a column with `CMT_0` (like you'd do in `$MAIN`).
-  When each ID is simulated, the `idata` value will override the base initial 
list for that subject.
-  But note that if `CMT_0` is set in `$MAIN`, that will override the `idata` 
update.

``` {r,init-by-idata-expand.idata}
idata <- expand.idata(CENT_0 = seq(0,25,1))
```

``` {r,init-by-idata-expand.idata-2}
idata %>% head
```


``` {r topic-init-10,cache=TRUE}
out <- 
  mod %>% 
  idata_set(idata) %>% 
  mrgsim(end=40)
```

``` {r topic-init-11,cache=TRUE}
plot(out, CENT~.)
```


## Updating parameters {#topic-parameter-update}

The parameter list was introduced in section \@ref(component-param) and the
`$PARAM` code block was shown in \@ref(block-param). Once a model is compiled,
the names and number of parameters in a model is fixed. However, the values of
parameters can be changed: parameters may be updated either by the user (in `R`)
or by `mrgsolve` (in the `C++` simulation engine, as the simulation proceeds).

* To update in `R`, use the `param()` function (see examples below)
* To have `mrgsolve` update the parameters, attach columns to your data set
(either `data_set` or `idata_set`) with the same name as items in the parameter
list

Both of these methods are discussed and illustrated in the following sections.

### Parameter update hierarchy

As we noted above, new parameter values can come from three potential sources:

1. Modification of the (base) parameter list
1. A column in an `idata_set` that has the same name as a model parameter
1. A column in a `data_set` that has the same name as a model parameter

These sources for new parameter values are discussed below.  We note here that
the sources listed above are listed in the order of the parameter update
*hierarchy*.  So, the base parameter list provides the value by default.  A
parameter value coming from an `idata_set` will override the value in the base
list.  And a parameter value coming from a `data_set` will override the value
coming from the base list or an `idata_set` (in case a parameter is listed in
both the `idata_set` and the `data_set`).  In other words, the hierarchy is:

1. base parameter list is the default
1. the `idata_set` overrides the base list
1. the `data_set` overrides the `idata_set` and the base list

The parameter update hierarchy is discussed in the following sections.

__Base parameter set__

* Every model has a base set of "parameters"
* These are named and set in `$PARAM`
* Parameters can only get into the parameter list in `$PARAM` (or `$THETA`)
* No changing the names or numbers of parameters once the model is compiled
* But, several ways to change the values

```{r,message=FALSE}
code <- '
$VCMT KYLE
$PARAM CL = 1.1, VC=23.1, KA=1.7, KM=10
$CAPTURE CL VC KA KM
'
mod <- mcode("tmp", code, warn=FALSE)
```

```{r}
param(mod)
```

__The base parameter set is the default__

The base parameter set allows you to run the model without entering any other 
data; there are some default values in place.  

__The parameters in the base list can be changed or updated in `R`__

Use the `param()` function to both set and get:

```{r}
mod <-  param(mod, CL=2.1)
```

```{r}
param(mod)
```
But whatever you've done in `R`, there is a base set (with values) to use. 
See section \@ref(topic-parameter-update-base) for a more detailed discussion 
of using `param()` to updated the base list.

__Parameters can also be updated during the simulation run__

Parameters can be updated by putting columns in `idata` set or `data_set` that 
have the same name as one of the parameters in the parameter list.  But there 
is no changing values in the base parameter set once the simulation starts.  
That is, the following model specification will not compile:

```{c,eval=FALSE}
$PARAM CL = 2

$MAIN CL = 3; // ERROR
```

You cannot over-write the value of a parameter in the model specification.  
Let `mrgsolve` do the updating.

`mrgsolve` always reverts to the base parameter set when starting work on a 
new individual.

__Parameters updated from `idata_set`__

When `mrgsolve` finds parameters in `idata`, it will update the base parameter 
list with those parameters prior to starting that individual.

```{r}
data(exidata)
head(exidata)
```

Notice that there are several columns in `exidata` that match up with the names
in the parameter list
```{r}
names(exidata)

names(param(mod))
```

The matching names tell `mrgsolve` to update, assigning each individual 
their individual parameter.


```{r topic-pars-4,cache=TRUE}
out <- 
  mod %>%
  idata_set(exidata) %>%
  mrgsim(end=-1 , add=c(0,2))
```

```{r}
out
```

__Parameters updated from `data_set`__

Like an `idata` set, we can put parameters on a `data` set

```{r}
data <- expand.ev(amt=0, CL=c(1,2,3), VC=30)
```

```{r topic-pars-5, cache=TRUE}
out <- 
  mod %>%
  data_set(data) %>% 
  obsonly %>%
  mrgsim(end=-1, add=c(0,2))
```
```{r}
out
```

This is how we do time-varying parameters:
```{r}
data <- 
  data_frame(CL=seq(1,5)) %>%
  mutate(evid=0,ID=1,cmt=1,time=CL-1,amt=0)
```

```{r}
mod %>%
  data_set(data) %>%
  mrgsim(end=-1)
```

For more information on time-varying covariates 
(parameters), see sections \@ref(topics-time-varying) and \@ref(section-sequence).


__Parameters are carried back when first record isn't at `time == 0`__

What about this?

```{r}
data <- expand.ev(amt=100,time=24,CL=5,VC=32)
data
```

The first `data` record happens at `time==24`

```{r}
mod %>% 
  data_set(data) %>%
  mrgsim(end=-1, add=c(0,2))
```

Since the data set doesn't start until `time==5`, we might think that `CL`
doesn't change from the base parameter set until then.

But by default, `mrgsolve` carries those parameter values back to the start of
the simulation.  This is by design ... by far the more useful configuration.

If you wanted the base parameter set in play until that first data set record,
do this:

```{r}
mod %>%
  data_set(data) %>%
  mrgsim(end=-1,add=c(0,2), filbak=FALSE)
```

Will this work? 

```{r}

idata <- do.call("expand.idata", as.list(param(mod)))

idata

```
Here, we'll pass in __both__ `data_set` and `idata_set` and they have
conflicting values for the parameters.

```{r}

mod %>%
  data_set(data) %>%
  idata_set(idata) %>%
  mrgsim(end=-1,add=c(0,2))
```

The data set always gets the last word.


### Updating the base parameter list {#topic-parameter-update-base}

From the previous section
```{r}
param(mod)
```

__Update with `name-value` pairs__

We can call `param()` to update the model object, directly naming the parameter
to update and the new value to take

```{r}
mod %>% param(CL = 777, KM = 999) %>% param
```

The parameter list can also be updated by scanning the names in a list

```{r}
what <- list(CL = 555, VC = 888, KYLE = 123, MN = 100)

mod %>% param(what) %>% param
```

`mrgsolve` looks at the names to drive the update.  `KYLE` (a compartment name)
and `MN` (not in the model anywhere) are ignored.

Alternatively, we can pick a row from a data frame to provide the input for the
update

```{r}
d <- data_frame(CL=c(9,10), VC=c(11,12), KTB=c(13,14))

mod %>% param(d[2,]) %>% param

```

Here the second row in the data frame drives the update.  Other names are ignored.  

A warning will be issued if an update is attempted, but no matching names are found
```{r,eval=FALSE}
mod %>% param(ZIP = 1, CODE = 2) %>% param
```

```
Warning message:
Found nothing to update: param 
```



## Time grid objects {#topic-tgrid}

__Simulation times in `mrgsolve`__

```{r}
mod <- mrgsolve:::house() %>% Req(CP) %>% ev(amt=1000,ii=24, addl=1000) 
```


`mrgsolve` keeps track of a simulation `start` and `end` time and a fixed size
step between `start` and `end` (called `delta`).  `mrgsolve` also keeps an
arbitrary vector of simulation times called `add`.

```{r}
mod %>%
  mrgsim(end=4,delta=2,add=c(7,9,50)) %>%
  as.data.frame
```


__`tgrid` objects__

The `tgrid` object abstracts this setup and allows us to make complicated
sampling designs from elementary building blocks.

__Make a day 1 sampling with intensive sampling around the peak and sparser otherwise__
```{r}
peak1 <- tgrid(1,4,0.1)
sparse1 <- tgrid(0,24,4)
```

__Use the `c` operator to combine simpler designs into more complicated designs__
```{r}
day1 <- c(peak1,sparse1)
```

Check this by calling `stime`
```{r}
stime(day1)
```

Pass this object in to `mrgsim` as `tgrid`.  It will override the default
`start/end/delta/add` sequence.
```{r topic-tgrid-1, cache=TRUE}
mod %>% 
  mrgsim(tgrid=day1) %>%
  plot(type='b')
```


__Now, look at both day 1 and day 10__:

Adding a number to a `tgrid` object will offset those times by that amount.  

```{r topic-tgrid-2, cache=TRUE}
des <- c(day1, day1+10*24)

mod %>% 
  mrgsim(tgrid=des) %>%
  plot(type='b')


```

Pick up day 5 as well

```{r topic-tgrid-3, cache=TRUE}
des <- c(des, day1+5*24)

mod %>% 
  mrgsim(tgrid=des) %>%
  plot(type='b')
```



## Individualized sampling designs {#topic-designs}

Here is a PopPK model and a full `data_set`.

```{r}
mod <- mrgsolve:::house()

data(exTheoph)

df <- exTheoph

head(df)
```

```{r topic-tgrid-5,cache=TRUE}
mod %>% 
  Req(CP) %>%
  carry.out(a.u.g) %>%
  data_set(df) %>%
  obsaug %>%
  mrgsim 
```

Now, define two time grid objects: `des1` runs from 0 to 24 and `des2` runs from
0 to 96, both every hour.
```{r}

des1 <- tgrid(0,24,1)
des2 <- tgrid(0,96,1)

range(stime(des1))
range(stime(des2))
```

Now, derive an `idata_set` after adding a grouping column (`GRP`) that splits
the data set into two groups
```{r}
df <-  mutate(df, GRP = as.integer(ID > 5))

id <- df %>% distinct(ID,GRP) 

id
```

Now, we have two groups in `GRP` in `idata_set` and we have two `tgrid` objects.  

* Pass in both the `idata_set` and the `data_set`
* Call `design`
* Identify `GRP` as `descol`; the column __must__ be in `idata_set`
* Pass in a list of designs; it __must__ be at least two because there are two levels in `GRP`


When we simulate, the individuals in `GRP 1` will get `des1` and those in `GRP
2` will get `des2`

```{r topic-design-1,cache=TRUE}
out <- 
  mod %>% 
  Req(CP) %>%
  carry.out(a.u.g,GRP) %>%
  idata_set(id) %>%
  data_set(df) %>%
  design(descol="GRP", deslist=list(des1,des2)) %>%
  obsaug %>%
  mrgsim 

plot(out, CP~time|GRP)
```


## Some helpful `C++`

Recall that the following blocks require valid `C++` code:

1. `$PREAMBLE`
1. `$MAIN`
1. `$ODE`
1. `$TABLE`
1. `$GLOBAL`
1. `$PRED`

We don't want users to have to be proficient in `C++` to be able to use mrgsolve.
and we've created several macros to help simplify things as much as possible.   
However, it is required to become familiar with some of the basics and certainly
additional knowledge of how to do more than just the basics will help you 
code more and more complicated models in mrgsolve.  

There are an unending stream of tutorials, references and help pages on `C++`
to be found on the interweb.  As a general source, I like to use 
https://en.cppreference.com/.  But, again, there many other good resources 
out there that can suit your needs.  

The rest of this section provides a very general reference of the types of 
`C++` code and functions that you might be using in your model. 

### Semi-colons

Every statement in `C++` must end with a semi-colon.  For example;

```{c, eval=FALSE}
[ MAIN ] 
double CL = exp(log_TVCL + ETA(1));
```

or

```{c, eval=FALSE}
[ ODE ] 

dxdt_DEPOT = -KA * DEPOT;
```

### if-else

```{c,eval=FALSE}
if(a == 2) b = 2;
```

```{c,eval=FALSE}
if(a==2) {
  b = 2;  
}
```


```{c,eval=FALSE}
if(a == 2) {
  b=2;
} else {
  b=3;
}
```

This is the equivalent of `x <- ifelse(c == 4, 8, 10)` in R
```{c,eval=FALSE}
double x = c == 4 ? 8 : 10;
```

### Functions

The following functions are hopefully understandable based on the function 
name.  Consult https://cppreference.com for further details.

```{c, eval=FALSE}
# base^exponent
double d = pow(base,exponent);

double e = exp(3);

# absolute value
double f = fabs(-4);

double g = sqrt(5);

double h = log(6);

double i = log10(7);

double j = floor(4.2);

double k = ceil(4.2);

double l = std::max(0.0, -3.0);

double m = std::min(0.0, -3.0);
```

### Integer division

The user is warned about division with two integers.  In `R`, the following 
statement evaluates to `0.75`:

```{r}
3/4
```

But in `C++` it evaluates to 0:

```{c, eval=FALSE}
double x = 3/4;
```

This is because both the `3` and the `4` are taken as integer literals.  This 
produces the same result as

```{c, eval=FALSE}
int a = 3;
int b = 4;
double x = a/b;
```

When one integer is divided by another integer, the remainder is discarded (the 
result is rounded down).  This is the way `C++` works.  The user is warned. 

Note that parameters in mrgsolve are `doubles` so this will evaluate to `0.75`

```{c, eval=FALSE}
[ PARAM ] a = 3

[ MAIN ] 
double x = a/4;
```

Since `a` is a parameter the operation of `a/4` is not integer division and 
the result is `0.75`.  

Unless you are already very comfortable with this concept, users are encouraged
to add `.0` suffix to any literal number __written as C++ code__.  For example:

```{c,eval=FALSE}
double x = 3.0 / 4.0;
```

I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of time you want this to 
evaluate to `0.75` and writing `3.0/4.0` rather than `3/4` will ensure you 
will not discard any remainder here.

If you would like to experiment with these concepts, try running this code

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(mrgsolve)

code <- '
[ param ] a = 3

[ main ] 
capture x = 3/4;
capture y = 3.0/4.0;
capture z = a/4;
'
mod <- mcode("foo", code)

mrgsim(mod)
```


### Pre-processor directives

Pre-processor directives are global substitutions that are made in your 
model code at the time the model is compiled. For example

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$GLOBAL 

#define CP (CENT/VC)
```

When you write this into your model, the pre-processor will find every 
instance of `CP` and __replace__ it with `(CENT/VC)`. This substitution 
happens right as the model is compiled; you won't see this substitution happen
anywhere, but think of it as literal replacement of `CP` with `(CENT/VC)`. 

__Note__:

- Put all pre-processor directives in `$GLOBAL`.
- It is usually a good idea to enclose the substituted coded in parentheses; 
  this ensures that, for example, `CENT/VC` is evaluated as is, regardless of 
  the surrounding code where it is evaluated.
- Under the hood, mrgsolve uses lots of pre-processor directives to define
  parameter names, compartment names and other variables; you will see a compiler
  error if you try to re-define an existing pre-processor directive. If so, 
  just choose another name for your directive.


## Resimulate `ETA` and `EPS`


__Call `simeps(n)` to resimulate `ETA`__

- No `$PLUGIN` is required
- `simeta(n)` takes a single argument (`n`), the ETA number to resimulate

For example, we can simulate individual-level covariates
within a certain range:

```{r topic-simeta-1, cache=TRUE}
code <- '
$PARAM TVCL = 1, TVWT = 70

$MAIN 
capture WT = TVWT*exp(EWT);

int i = 0;

while((WT < 60) || (WT > 80)) {
  if(++i > 100) break;
  simeta(1);
  WT = TVWT*exp(EWT);
}

$OMEGA @labels EWT
4

$CAPTURE EWT WT
'

mod <- mcode("simeta", code)

out <- mod %>% mrgsim(nid=100, end=-1)

sum <- summary(out)

sum
```


__Call `simeps(n)` to resimulate `EPS`__

- No `$PLUGIN` is required
- `simeps()` takes a single argument (`n`), the EPS number to resimulate

For example, we can resimulate until all 
concentrations are greater than zero:

```{r topic-simeps-1,cache=TRUE}
code <- '
$PARAM CL = 1, V = 20,

$CMT CENT

$SIGMA 50

$PKMODEL ncmt=1

$TABLE
capture CP = CENT/V + EPS(1);

int i = 0;

while(CP < 0 && i < 100) {
  simeps(1);
  CP = CENT/V + EPS(1);
  ++i;
}

'

mod <- mcode("simeps", code)

out <- mod %>% ev(amt=100) %>% mrgsim(end=48)
sum <- summary(out)

sum
```


__A safety check is recommended__
Note that in both examples, we implement a safety check: an integer counter is
incremented every time we resimulated.  The resimulation process stops if we
don't reach the desired condition within 100 replicates.  You might also
consider issuing a message or a flag in the simulated data if you are not able
to reach the desired condition.


## Time varying covariates {#topics-time-varying}

A note in a previous section showed how to implement time-varying covariates or
other time-varying parameters by including those parameters as column in the
data set.

By default, `mrgsolve` performs next observation carried backward (`nocb`) when
processing time-varying covariates.  That is, when the system advances from
`TIME1` to `TIME2`, and the advance is a function of a covariate found in the
data set, the system advances using the covariate value `COV2` rather than the
covariate `COV1`.

The user can change the behavior to last observation carried forward (`locf`),
so that the system uses the value of `COV1` to advance from `TIME1` to `TIME2`.
To use `locf` advance, set `nocb` to `FALSE` when calling `mrgsim`.  For
example,

```{r,eval = FALSE}
mod %>% mrgsim(nocb = FALSE)
```

There is additional information about the sequence of events that takes place
during system advance in section \@ref(section-sequence).
