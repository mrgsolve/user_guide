# Modeled events {#mtime}

Modeled events are interventions that you can introduce into your 
simulation from within your model. These aren't any different in substance to 
the dosing records (`EVID=1`) or other intervention type records (`EVID=2`) 
that you might include in your input data set when you know what they are
before you run the simulation. Modeled events do the same thing (stop the 
simulation and execute some event at some time) but you don't need to know
about them prior to running the simulation. These are similar to the `MTIME` 
functionality that you get in NONMEM but they have a very different syntax and 
there is more functionality provided. 

Note that there is no way to get additional records in your simulated output.
Regardless of the approach or level of complexity, you will not see modeled 
events in your simulated output. These are always executed under the hood and 
the number of rows in the simulated output and their times will be the same 
regardless of what modeled events you set up as discussed here.

## Simple MTIME

Use this when you just want to introduce a non-dose discontinuity in your 
simulation at a specific time. For example, you want a parameter to change 
value at a specific time and you don't know about the values or times prior 
to simulating. 

To schedule a discontinuity, call the `mtime()` member (Section \@ref(self.time)) 
of the `self` object (Section \@ref(self-object)). This is typically done in 
the `$MAIN` block.

```{c, eval = FALSE}
[ main ]
double mt = self.mtime(14.12);

if(TIME >= mt) {
  // do something  
}
```

Here, we have told `mrgsolve` to stop at `14.12` hours so we can do something.
Notice that `self.mtime()` returns the value of the modeled even time so you 
can check it later. 

We can also schedule an event to happen some amount of time in the future

```{c, eval = FALSE}
[ main ]
if(NEWIND <= 1) {
  double mt = 1e9;  
}

if(EVID==1) {
  mt = self.mtime(TIME + 8.2);
}

if(TIME >= mt) {
  // do something  
}
```

## MTIME with specific EVID

You can call `self.mevent()` and pass both `time` and `evid` and then check 
for when that `EVID` comes around again. For example

```{c, eval = FALSE}
self.mevent(TIME + 8.2, 33);

if(EVID==33) {
  // do something  
}
```

This is similar in functionality to `self.mevent()`.

## Modeled doses

The previous examples showed you how to get the simulation to stop so you 
can do something in `$MAIN`. In this section, we show you how to schedule 
doses in a similar way. This will take some extra coding and will also serve
to uncover how `self.mtime()` and `self.mevent()` work.

You can set up the following code in either `$MAIN` or `$TABLE`.

___Create an evdata object___

Once you know when you want the dose, create an `evdata` object. 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
mrg::evdata ev(14.2, 1);
```

This will create (construct) an object called `ev` with class `evdata`. The 
constructor takes two arguments:

1. the `TIME` the event should happen
1. the `EVID` for the event 

This is the only available constructor for `evdata` objects. You can browse
the source code for the `evdata` object
[here](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/blob/develop/inst/base/mrgsolv.h).

__Modify the evdata object__
Once the object is created, you can modify the following public members

- `time`: the event time (`double`)
- `evid`: the event ID (`int`)
- `amt`: the dose amount (`double`)
- `cmt`: the compartment number (`int`)
- `rate`: the rate to infuse `amt` (`double`)
- `now`: should the dose be given immediately? (`bool`)

If you are using this (lower-level) interface, chances are you will want to 
set at least `amt` and `cmt`.  As an example, we will dose 100 mg into 
compartment 2 immediately (now)

```{c, eval = FALSE}
ev.amt = 100;
ev.cmt = 2;
ev.now = true;
```

The other members are set in a similar way.


__Push the evdata object into the self object__

After the object has been created and modified, you have to attach this object
to the `self` object in order to make it available to mrgsolve. Do this by 
calling `push_back()` on `self.mevector`

```{c, eval = FALSE}
self.mevector.push_back(ev);
```

Again, this sequence should get called in either `$MAIN` or `$TABLE`. When that 
code block finishes running (for the current record), `mrgsolve` will find the 
event record and add that event to the simulation sequence.
