# Introduction {-}
<img src="images/mrgsolve_hex.png" align="right" width="150px"></img> Welcome to
the mrgsolve user guide. The user guide is the main documentation source for how
mrgsolve works and how to best use mrgsolve in your modeling and simulation
project.  As with most of the mrgsolve documentation, this is a work in
progress.  I am currently working to transition this to more of a reference
resource, rather than demonstration.  So key content in the user guide includes
chapter \@ref(model-specification) on model specification, chapter
\@ref(model-components) on model components and chapter \@ref(section-sequence)
on the simulation sequence. Installation is a big topic but we defer to the wiki
page for installation help since requirements tend to change frequently with new
R releases.  The other content is hopefully helpful as well.  I'm leaving it all
in place for now, but will gradually transition the "how-to" and demo type
content over to the vignettes repository or the gallery repository (see
[below](#other-resources)).

Please feel free to ask questions about anything mrgsolve-related on the 
issue tracker on the main github repo: https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues.


## Overview {-}

If you are accessing the user guide via html, you should be able to see a 
table of contents on the left. That has a lot of detail in there so I'm going 
to give you high-level overview of what is here (the high-level should be 
pretty clear in the pdfbook). 

- Chapter \@ref(model-components) tells you about what is in the mrgsolve model
  object (like parameters, compartments, C++ functions and the like)
- Chapter \@ref(model-specification) tells you about model specification. There 
  are two main sections to this chapter: Section \@ref(code-blocks) lists 
  the different model code blocks and Section \@ref(variables-macros) lists
  the different variables that you can get (or set) in the different code blocks
- Chapter \@ref(data-set-chapter) shows you how to format input data sets
- Chapter \@ref(event-chapter) shows you how to create and work with simple 
  data set objects called `event` objects
- Chapter \@ref(matrix-chapter) shows how to work with model matrices
- Chapter \@ref(simulated-output) tells you about the simulated output object
  and how you can work with it
- Chapter \@ref(section-sequence) dives into the simulation sequence, showing 
  you the steps that mrgsolve takes to work through a problem
- Chapter \@ref(steady-state) gives the details on how mrgsolve advances the 
  system to a pharmacokinetic steady state
- Chapter \@ref(plugins) talks about different plugins you can use for more 
  advanced modeling
- Chapter \@ref(mtime) talks about modeled events (discontinuities in the 
  simulation that are triggered from within the model rather than from the 
  data set)
- Chapter \@ref(topics) is a collection of applied examples on different topics
- Chapter \@ref(q-and-a) are brief questions and answers providing some bits
  of information that don't obviously fit into another chapter
- Chapter \@ref(install) provides links to some Wiki pages that can help with 
  installation
