# Model components

This chapter details the different components of a model in `mrgsolve`.  
Each component listed here is maintained within a "model object".  This is 
an updatable S4 object in `R` that contains all of the basic information 
required to properly configure and simulate from the model. 

## Parameter list {#component-param}

The parameter list is an updatable set of name-value pairs. Referencing the name 
of an item in the parameter list will substitute the current value associated 
with that name.  While the name "paramter" may have a certain connotation in 
the modeling world, in `mrgsolve` a "parameter" could be any category of 
numeric data: covariates (e.g. `WT`, `AGE`, `SEX`), flags, other numeric 
data that we commonly call "parameter" (e.g. `CL` or `VC`).  

The parameter list is declared in the code block `$PARAM`.  While there may 
be multiple `$PARAM` blocks in a model, these are condensed to a single 
parameter list stored in the model object.  The names and numbers of all 
parameters in the model must be declared at the time that the model is 
compiled.  Also, a default value for each parameter must be declared at 
model compile time, but the value of each parameter may be updated in 
one of several ways. 

The parameters in a model object can be queried or updated with the 
`param()` function.

See also: \@ref(block-param), `?param` in the `R` help system after 
loading `mrgsolve`.

### Central role of parameters in planning simulations
The data items in the parameter list are more than just values associated with 
a name.  When an name is added to the parameter list, that name becomes a key 
word that `mrgsolve` will start to recognize in input data sets or when 
manipulting the model object.  

For example, when you want to include a covariate in the model, say weight 
(`WT`), you'll include a column in the data set called `WT` that will indicate 
the weight of this or that patient.  It is crutial that you also list `WT` in 
`$PARAM` with some default value.  It helps if that value is sensible too.  
When `mrgsolve` receives the data set prior to simulating, the `WT` column 
is matched up with the `WT` parameter name.  As `mrgsolve` works its way 
through the input data set (from person to person or from time to time), 
the value of `WT` is updated so that the symbol `WT` in `$MAIN` or `$ODE` 
or `$TABLE` always points to the value of `WT`.  If the `WT` name is not 
in the parameter list, it won't matter if it is in the data set or not.  
Only listing a name in `$PARAM` gets it "into the game".  

Understanding the parameter update mechanism is very important for planning 
complicated simulations with `mrgsolve`.  Please see the information in 
\@ref(datasets) and in \@ref(topic-parameter-update).


## Compartment list {#component-init}
Like the parameter list, the compartment list is a series of name-value pairs.  
The compartment list defines the number, names, and initial values of each 
compartment in the model.     The names, numbers, and order of the compartment 
in a model is established at the time of model compile and changes to the 
compartment list require re-compilation of the model.  

Compartments are declared in one of two code blocks: `$INIT` and `$CMT`. 
Nominal initial values must be supplied for each compartment.  The main 
difference between `$INIT` and `$CMT` is that `$CMT` assumes a default 
initial value of 0 for each compartment; thus only compartment names are 
entered.  When using `$INIT`, both names and values must be explicitly stated 
for each compartment.  

The initial values for each compartment can be queried with the `init()` 
function.  There are several different ways to set the initial conditions 
in a model; section \@ref(topic-init) illustrates several of these.

See also: section \@ref(topic-init) and `?init` in the `R` help system after 
loading `mrgsolve`.

## Simulation time grid {#component-stime}

The `mrgsolve` model object stores the parameters for the series of 
time points to be output for a a simulation.  This is the default output 
time grid that will be used if not over-ridden by another mechanism.  

The elements of the simulation time grid are: `start`, `end`, `delta` and 
`add`.  `start`, `end`, `delta` are passed to `seq()` as `from`, `to`, and `by`, respectively. `add` is any arbitrary vector of additional times to simulate.  

The simulation time grid in a model object may be queried with the `stime()` 
function or by printing the model object to the `R` console. 

See also section \@ref(data-set) for discussion of the simulation time grid 
and input data sets and \@ref(component-tgrid) and \@ref(topic-tgrid) for 
using time grid objects . 


### `tgrid` objects {#component-tgrid}

A `tgrid` object has `start`, `end`, `delta` and `add` attributes.  
This object is independent of the model object.  `tgrid` objects may be 
created and combined to create complex sampling designs.

See section \@ref(topic-tgrid) for examples and usage.

## Solver settings
`mrgsolve` uses the `DLSODA` solver from `ODEPACK`. Several of the settings 
for that solver are stored in the model object and passed to the solver when
the problem is started.  Settings include: `atol`, `rtol`, `maxsteps`, `hmax`,
`hmin`, `ixpr`, `mxhnil`.  

## Functions

There are three `C++` functions that `mrgsolve` creates and manages: `MAIN`, 
`ODE`, `TABLE`. Each function is created from an entire code block in the model
specification file.  The user is responsible for writing correct `C++` code 
in each of these blocks.  `mrgsolve` will parse these blocks and augment this 
code with the necessary elements to create the `C++` function. 

These functions may be specified in any order in the model specification file, 
but there is a __specific calling order__ for these functions.  Recognizing 
and understanding this calling order will help understand how the different 
pieces of the model specification fit together.  During advance from time 
`T1` to `T2`, first `$MAIN` is called, then `$ODE` is called repeatedly as 
the solver finds the values of state variables at `T2`, and, once the solution 
is found, `$TABLE` is called to calculate derived quantities at `T2` and to 
specify variables that should be included in the model output.  So, it is 
helpful to write model specification files in the order:

1. `$MAIN`  - __before__ advancing the system
2. `$ODE`   - the system __advances__ to `T2`
3. `$TABLE` - __after__ advancing the system

But the order in which they are coded will not affect model compilation or the simulation result. 

### The `$MAIN` function

The `MAIN` function gets called at least once before the the solver advances 
from the current time (`T1`) to the next time (`T2`).  In the `MAIN` function, 
the user may:

* Set initial conditions for any compartment
* Derive new variables to be used in the model
* Write covariate models
* Add between-subject variability to quantities to structural model 
paramters (e.g. `CL` or `VC`).  

In addition to getting called once per record, the `MAIN` function may be 
called several times prior to starting the simulation run.  The `MAIN` 
function is also called whenever the user queries the compartment list. 

See \@ref(block-main) for details.


### The `$ODE` function

The `ODE` function is where the user writes the model differential equations.  
Any derived quantity that depends on a state variable and is used to to 
calculate the differentation must be calculated inside `$ODE`.  But, this 
function is called repeatedly during the simulation run, so any calculation 
that __can__ be moved out of `$ODE` (for example: to `$MAIN`) should be.  

See \@ref(block-ode) for details.


### The `$TABLE` function
The `TABLE` function is called __after__ the solver advances in time.  The 
purpose of `TABLE` is to allow the user to interact with the values of the 
state variables after advancing, potentially derive new variables, and to 
insert different outputs into the table of simulated results. 

See \@ref(block-table) for details.


## Random effect variances
The `mrgsolve` model object keeps track of a arbitrary number of block 
matrices that are used to simulate variates from multivariate normal 
distributions.  Users can specify `OMEGA` matrices for simulating 
between-subject random effects (one draw per individual) or `SIGMA` 
matrices for simulating within-subject random effects (one draw per 
observation).  

The user may use the `revar()` function to query both `OMEGA` and `SIGMA`.

### `OMEGA`
The matrices are specified in `$OMEGA` blocks in the model specification file. 

`OMEGA` may be queried or updated with the `omat()` function. 

### `SIGMA`
The matrices are specified in `$SIGMA` blocks in the model specification file.  

`SIGMA` may be queried or updated by the `smat()` function.
