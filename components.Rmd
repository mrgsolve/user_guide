# Model components {#model-components}

This chapter details the different components of a model in `mrgsolve`. Each
component listed here is maintained within a "model object".  This is an
updatable S4 object in `R` that contains all of the basic information required
to properly configure and simulate from the model.

## Parameter list {#component-param}

The parameter list is an updatable set of name-value pairs. Referencing the name
of an item in the parameter list will substitute the current value associated
with that name.  While the name "parameter" may have a certain connotation in
the modeling world, in `mrgsolve` a "parameter" could be any category of numeric
data: covariates (e.g. `WT`, `AGE`, `SEX`), flags, other numeric data that we
commonly call "parameter" (e.g. `CL` or `VC`).

The parameter list is declared in the code block `$PARAM`.  While there may be
multiple `$PARAM` blocks in a model, these are condensed to a single parameter
list stored in the model object.  The names and numbers of all parameters in the
model must be declared at the time that the model is compiled.  Also, a default
value for each parameter must be declared at model compile time, but the value
of each parameter may be updated in one of several ways.

The parameters in a model object can be queried or updated with the 
`param()` function.

See also: \@ref(block-param), `?param` in the `R` help system after 
loading `mrgsolve`.

### Central role of parameters in planning simulations
The data items in the parameter list are more than just values associated with a
name.  When an name is added to the parameter list, that name becomes a key word
that `mrgsolve` will start to recognize in input data sets or when manipulating
the model object.

For example, when you want to include a covariate in the model, say weight
(`WT`), you'll include a column in the data set called `WT` that will indicate
the weight of this or that patient.  It is crucial that you also list `WT` in
`$PARAM` with some default value.  It helps if that value is sensible too. When
`mrgsolve` receives the data set prior to simulating, the `WT` column is matched
up with the `WT` parameter name.  As `mrgsolve` works its way through the input
data set (from person to person or from time to time), the value of `WT` is
updated so that the symbol `WT` in `$MAIN` or `$ODE` or `$TABLE` always points
to the value of `WT`.  If the `WT` name is not in the parameter list, it won't
matter if it is in the data set or not. Only listing a name in `$PARAM` gets it
"into the game".

Understanding the parameter update mechanism is very important for planning
complicated simulations with `mrgsolve`.  Please see the information in
\@ref(datasets) and in \@ref(topic-parameter-update).


## Compartment list {#component-init}
Like the parameter list, the compartment list is a series of name-value pairs.
The compartment list defines the number, names, and initial values of each
compartment in the model.     The names, numbers, and order of the compartment
in a model is established at the time of model compile and changes to the
compartment list require re-compilation of the model.

Compartments are declared in one of two code blocks: `$INIT` and `$CMT`. Nominal
initial values must be supplied for each compartment.  The main difference
between `$INIT` and `$CMT` is that `$CMT` assumes a default initial value of 0
for each compartment; thus only compartment names are entered.  When using
`$INIT`, both names and values must be explicitly stated for each compartment.

The initial values for each compartment can be queried with the `init()`
function.  There are several different ways to set the initial conditions in a
model; section \@ref(topic-init) illustrates several of these.

See also: section \@ref(topic-init) and `?init` in the `R` help system after
loading `mrgsolve`.

## Simulation time grid {#component-stime}

The `mrgsolve` model object stores the parameters for the series of time points
to be output for a a simulation.  This is the default output time grid that will
be used if not over-ridden by another mechanism.

The elements of the simulation time grid are: `start`, `end`, `delta` and `add`.
`start`, `end`, `delta` are passed to `seq()` as `from`, `to`, and `by`,
respectively. `add` is any arbitrary vector of additional times to simulate.

The simulation time grid in a model object may be queried with the `stime()` 
function or by printing the model object to the `R` console. 

See also section \@ref(data-set) for discussion of the simulation time grid 
and input data sets and \@ref(component-tgrid) and \@ref(topic-tgrid) for 
using time grid objects . 


### `tgrid` objects {#component-tgrid}

A `tgrid` object has `start`, `end`, `delta` and `add` attributes. This object
is independent of the model object.  `tgrid` objects may be created and combined
to create complex sampling designs.

See section \@ref(topic-tgrid) for examples and usage.

## Solver settings
`mrgsolve` uses the `DLSODA` solver from `ODEPACK`. Several of the settings 
for that solver are stored in the model object and passed to the solver when
the problem is started.  Settings include: `atol`, `rtol`, `maxsteps`, `hmax`,
`hmin`, `ixpr`, `mxhnil`.  

### `atol`

Absolute tolerance parameter. Adjust this value lower when you see state variables
(compartments) that are becoming very small and possibly turning negative. For
example:

```{r}
mod <- modlib("viral1", end = 144) 

out <- mrgsim_e(mod, ev(amt = 1000)) %>% filter(V < 0)

out
```


Adjusting `atol` to `1E-20` or `1E-30` will prevent this. 

```{r}
mrgsim_e(mod, ev(amt = 1000), atol = 1E-20)  %>% filter(time %in% out$time)
```


### `rtol` 

Relative tolerance parameter.  Adjust this value lower when you want more 
precision around the calculation of state variables as the system advances.  

### `maxsteps`

This is the maximum number of steps the solver will take when advancing from one
time to the next.  If the solver can't make it in `maxsteps` it will stop and
give an error message like this:

```{c,eval=FALSE}
DLSODA-  At current T (=R1), MXSTEP (=I1) steps   
      taken on this call before reaching TOUT     
In above message, I = 
[1] 2000
In above message, R = 
[1] 0.0004049985
DLSODA-  ISTATE (=I1) illegal.
In above message, I = 
[1] -1
DLSODA-  Run aborted.. apparent infinite loop.    
Error in (function (x, data, idata = null_idata, carry.out = character(0),  : 
  error from XERRWD
```

You might see this when you have to integrate along time between records in a
data set.  There isn't necessarily a problem, but the solver might have to
advance over many doses to get to the next record and it only has a limited
number of steps it can take between those records before it stops with this
error.

When you see this, increase `maxsteps` to 50000 or larger.  

But keep in mind that sometimes the solver can't make it to the next record
because there are issues with the model.  It might take thousands of steps to
make it 24 hours down the road.  In that case, go back to the model code and
look for problems in how it is coded.

### `hmax`

The __maximum__ step size.  By default, the solver will take steps of different
sizes based on what is happening in the simulation.  Setting `hmax` tells the
solver not to take a step larger than that value.  So in a model where `time` is
in hours, reducing `hmax` to `0.1` will prevent the solver from taking a step
larger than `0.1` hours as it tries to advance to the next time.  The will slow
down the simulation a bit.  But sometimes helpful when the solver starts taking
large steps.  We don't recommend using this routinely; for most applications, it
should be reserved for troubleshooting situations.  If your model doesn't give
the results that you want without setting `hmax`, we'd recommend a new setup
where this isn't needed.

### `hmin`

The __minimum__ step size.  Only set this if you know what you're doing.

### `ixpr`

A flag to enable printing messages to the R console when the solver
switches between non-stiff and stiff solving modes.  Rarely used.

### `mxhnil`

The maximum number of messages printed when the model is solving.  If you 
have a lot of messages, keep working on your model code. 

## Functions \ {#model-functions}

There are four `C++` functions that `mrgsolve` creates and manages: `PREAMBLE`,
`MAIN`, `ODE`, `TABLE`. Each function is created from an entire code block in
the model specification file.  The user is responsible for writing correct `C++`
code in each of these blocks.  mrgsolve will parse these blocks and augment this
code with the necessary elements to create the `C++` function.

These functions may be specified in any order in the model specification file, 
but there is a __specific calling order__ for these functions.  Recognizing 
and understanding this calling order will help understand how the different 
pieces of the model specification fit together.  

Just prior to starting the problem, mrgsolve calls `$PREAMBLE`.  Then, during
advance from time `T1` to `T2`, first `$MAIN` is called, then `$ODE` is called
repeatedly as the solver finds the values of state variables at `T2`, and, once
the solution is found, `$TABLE` is called to calculate derived quantities at
`T2` and to specify variables that should be included in the model output.  So,
it is helpful to write model specification files in the order:

1. `$PREAMBLE` -  called __only once__ just prior to processing the first record 
    of the data set
1. `$MAIN`  - __before__ advancing the system
1. `$ODE`   - the system __advances__ to `T2`
1. `$TABLE` - __after__ advancing the system

But the order in which they are coded will not affect model compilation or the 
simulation result. 

### The `$PREAMBLE` function

The `PREAMBLE` function gets called only once, just prior to processing the 
first record of the data set.  This function is composed of `C++` code and is
used to initialize variables and get them set up prior to starting on 
the problem. 

See \@ref(block-preamble) for details.

### The `$MAIN` function

The `MAIN` function gets called at least once before the the solver advances 
from the current time (`T1`) to the next time (`T2`).  In the `MAIN` function, 
the user may:

* Set initial conditions for any compartment
* Derive new variables to be used in the model
* Write covariate models
* Add between-subject variability to quantities to structural model 
parameters (e.g. `CL` or `VC`).  

In addition to getting called once per record, the `MAIN` function may be 
called several times prior to starting the simulation run.  The `MAIN` 
function is also called whenever the user queries the compartment list. 

mrgsolve allows you access compartment amounts in the `MAIN` function. But 
it is important to remember the calling order of these model functions
(section \@ref(model-functions)): because `MAIN` is called _before_ the system 
advances, the compartment amounts inside this function will reflect the 
pre-advance values. This is in contrast to accessing compartment amounts 
inside the `TABLE` function, which will reflect the values _after_ the
system advances. While there are some use cases where it is useful 
to check the pre-advance compartment amounts in `MAIN`, most applications
should interact with compartment amounts after the system advances in 
`TABLE`.

See \@ref(block-main) for details.


### The `$ODE` function

The `ODE` function is where the user writes the model differential equations.  
Any derived quantity that depends on a state variable and is used to 
advanced the system must be calculated inside `$ODE`.  But, this 
function is called repeatedly during the simulation run, so any calculation 
that __can__ be moved out of `$ODE` (for example: to `$MAIN`) should be.  

See \@ref(block-ode) for details.


### The `$TABLE` function
The `TABLE` function is called __after__ the solver advances in time.  The 
purpose of `TABLE` is to allow the user to interact with the values of the 
state variables after advancing, potentially derive new variables, and to 
insert different outputs into the table of simulated results. 

See \@ref(block-table) for details.


## Random effect variances
The `mrgsolve` model object keeps track of a arbitrary number of block matrices
that are used to simulate variates from multivariate normal distributions.
Users can specify `OMEGA` matrices for simulating between-subject random effects
(one draw per individual) or `SIGMA` matrices for simulating within-subject
random effects (one draw per observation).

The user may use the `revar()` function to query both `OMEGA` and `SIGMA`.

### `OMEGA`
The matrices are specified in `$OMEGA` blocks in the model specification file. 

`OMEGA` may be queried or updated with the `omat()` function. 

### `SIGMA`
The matrices are specified in `$SIGMA` blocks in the model specification file.  

`SIGMA` may be queried or updated by the `smat()` function.
